// forEach Array Helper Method

// The forEach array helper method takes an array and calls a function that
// we provide on each item in the array.

// Array helper methods are built in to the array object in Javascript. In the past,
// these helper methods have been implemented by utlity libraries such as lodash.js and underscore.js.

// Array helper methods allow us to stop using manual for loops when dealing with collections of data in arrays.

// One of Stephen's biggest jumps as a programmer in general was when he really mastered each of the helper methods discussed in this section.
// By getting to know these methods well, you will be better equipped to work with collections of data, which is a big part of
// developing modern web applications today.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Array.prototype.forEach();

// The forEach() method executes a provided function once per array element.

// We declare the variable colours and assign it to an array literal with our colour names as strings.
var colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];

// The reason we want to avoid writing for loops like the one below is that there is a lot of
// unnecessary logic involved which provides more points of failue (typos, etc.) than if we just
// used a much simpler solution, like a built in helper method.
for (var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  console.log(colors[i]);
}

// We invoke the .forEach array helper method that is built into the array object in javascript
// and pass in an annonymous function that logs each item of the array to console.

// Our annonymous function can be referred to as an 'interator function' as it is invoked
// in every iteration of our loop.

colors.forEach(function (color) {
  console.log(color);
});

// Stephen argues that one of the key reasons to use a helper method over a generic for loop is that
// we can achieve the same result while writing much less logic.

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// forEach continued.

// Tasks:

// --> Create an array of numbers
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// --> Create a variable to hold the sum
var sum = 0;

// --> Loop over the array, incrementing the sum variable

// An alternative here is to define the function seperately and then pass the function into .forEach().
// If we did use a seperate function, we would not pass it with parens, which would invoke it and pass the result,
// as what we want is for the function to invoked seperately for each iteration in our array.

numbers.forEach(function (number, index) {
  // the first paramater of forEach is the callback function to execute
  console.log(index); // for each element of the array, which takes three arguments:
  sum += number;
}); // currentValue : The current element being processed in the array
// index: The index of the current element being processed in the array
// --> Print the sum variable				// array: The array that forEach() is being applied to.
console.log(sum);
